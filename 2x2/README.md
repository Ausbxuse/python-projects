# 2x2 Rubik's Cube Solver

This program generates short solutions to particular scrambles that the user does.
The program uses BFS algorithm to search for a solution to a given scramble.

## 2-D rendering

It also shows you the scrambled state in 2-D, given that your terminal has 256-color support

## NOTE
Although it asks you to scramble the cube and you might think the program just "unscramle" it by reversing the steps. Try entering ```RUR'U'RUR'U'RUR'U'RUR'U'RUR'U'```, the program will solve it in 4 moves.
To run the program, type in the terminal:

```
cd 2x2;
python3 2x2.py
```
